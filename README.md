# Springboard_CapstoneProject
During the course of Introduction to Data Science, every student needs to commit himself to produce a Capstone Project. This is one of the most important parts of this course as it gives students practice in the typical Data Science workflow and it can represent a tangible prove of their quality and knowledges.
